# Decision-Tree

## The decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm for classification or regression problems, and can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in a dataset. It looks very similar to a binary tree, and it's heavily revolved around recursion.

## The two most important concepts are entropy and information gain. An extropy measures how scrambled the values in a dataset column is, and we can think of it as measuring the variance. Inversely, information gain is the reduction in entropy by transforming a dataset, and we can think of it as spliting a dataset into two branches, and Information gain = the original entropy - the weighted entropies of each branch.
